I'm Jose Antony, based in Chennai, with over 3 years of experience as a Python developer.
 During this time, I have successfully contributed to three distinct projects.

Project: Fyxt

Fyxt is a comprehensive property management system designed to facilitate seamless communication between property
 owners, tenants, and vendors. The platform streamlines issue resolution, such as plumbing concerns, by utilizing
 a ticketing system. In this project, I implemented the multi-tenant concept, replica mail behavior, chat functionality,
  ticket management, and service planning.

Project: Marlo

Marlo focuses on providing loan products, particularly for ship owners. It extends its services to non-ship owners as
 well, allowing them to apply for loans related to their voyage processes. The project incorporates features like
  vessel tracking and loan application management using technologies such as CRM, Django, GraphQL, and PostgreSQL.

Project: Kauvery Kare Application

The Kauvery Kare Application serves as the official app for Kauvery Hospital, offering patients a seamless experience
 for booking both online and offline appointments, video calling, master health checkups, and managing health records.
  This microservices project employs technologies like FastAPI, Django, Kafka, and integrates various third-party tools.
