1) Explain time complexity and space complexity?

-> Time complexity represents the amount of time an algorithm takes with respect to the input size.
 Space complexity represents the amount of memory an algorithm uses with respect to the input size.
 Both are commonly expressed using Big O notation.

2) How python works?

python program run by interpreter
|
interpreter run the code and break into small pieces called token
|
interpreter organize the tokens into structure are called parse tree(to understand the structure of program)
|
interpreter convert parse tree to bytecode
|
interpreter convert bytecode to machine code(computer processor can understand)

3) Memory managed in python?

-> memory management in python is handled by "python memory manager".
-> memory allocated by manager is in form of a "private heap space".
-> it is inaccessible to the programmer.
-> python has in built "garbage collector" for recycle the un used memory in private heap space.

4) Namespace?

-> it ensure that objects names in program are unique and can be used without any conflict
-> local - cycle of function
-> global - cycle of script file/import package
-> built in - exception and etc

5) shallow copy vs deep copy?


6) range and xrange?


7) Pickling and Unpickling?


8) Generators?
